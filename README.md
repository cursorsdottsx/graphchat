# Reanvue

The Developer's Connection

## Development

### Web

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Serve
$ yarn dev:web

# Build for production and launch server
$ yarn build:web
$ yarn start:web
```

### Server

#### Environment variables

To run the server, you will have to create a file called `.env` and pass the variables from `.env.example` in it.

Make sure to update the `.env.example` file whenever you add new code that requires a new environment variable.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Serve
$ yarn dev:server

# Build for production and launch server
$ yarn build:server
$ yarn start:server
```
